  <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>For my mobile website I am thinking of making a Boba/Tapioca website. It is basically a drink place, so i research up place like jamba juice, starbucks, and so on. The store will be called Bobos and there slogan will be "Boba on the Go." They will sell drinks from different kinds of tea to smoothies and snacks. Users will be maybe to find our location of the day(since is a food truck). They will be able to look at the menu,and phone number. </p>
    <p>Research: All the research i went through i tried to go with a mobile site with a slider in the beginning because it is a drink website and i want toshow more images. I like how starbucks is a drinks place and there website is the way i want to go. The disney website I like the slider in the beginning. For the tie's website i like how the items are place and categorizes. My color scheme i want it to be light color maybe on a black or white background depending on the feel.</p>
